- we create a separate component for currency convertion
- we can get the currency information from frankfurter.app
- also the get request for convertion can be got in the same website
- we store those url in separate constants
- in the separate component we made for currency convetor, we can add content
- we build the ui by adding headind, dropdown, input , convert button , converted amount
- we create states for the currencies fetched and one more state for converted amount
- fetch currencies and set the state , but since we get the object response we need to set it with Object.keys(data) then we can set array to the state
- now we create a onClick function for the convert button
- render the currencies in the dropdown and we use same dropdown component for to and from currency
- two more states for fromCurrency and toCurrency
- so we use same dropdown component for 2 dropdowns and build a button in betweem them for swapping
- after the dropdown we import react-icons for \* icons to add to favourties and also make dummy methods to handle convertion and adding to favourites
- we can add new icon for swap currency button and handle the logic for it (setfromcurrnecy to tocurrency and vide versa)
- new 2 states for converted currency and isconverting state
- we make new api call to convert the courrencies
- we will have a new state for favourites and we will store our favourites in local storage so they persist
- handle the adding and removing from favourites
