- json data is provided which can be displayed as notes
- we use that data directly as state
- we use separate component to display the note div seprately by looping through notes array state
- use proper cursors on notes to give good effect
- we add logic for notes to take random position on the screen
- we store the position in local storage so it persists even after page is reloaded
