    • First we write down the ui components we need according to the UI showed in the   question
    • Also style them
    • We are using tailwind for this one for faster development
    • After all the UI we create states required
        ○ Character Length state related to the range bar
        ○  checkbox data state
    • Now we build logic for our app using custom hook
    • We create state inside custom hook , password and error states
    • Take the checkboData and build the logic using switch cases for the enabled check    boxed from UI and send it back
    • Build the strength bar based on length
