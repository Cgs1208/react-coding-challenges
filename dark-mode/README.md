- dark mode question is very famous interview question out of all
- here we use react router and navbar to navigate between the pages (we can use anything to display)
- things like theme where it is requried all over the app can be kept in contextAPI
- we can also use redux for this but since redux is not for simple things like these we use contextAPI
- we create the context with state for darkMode and also a toggle function to change the dark mode
- we are setting data attribute to the document so that we can use that in styling according to what it is set to
- finally we create a checkbox to enable and disable the dark mode
- if we need we can make better slider bar for the dark mode enabling
