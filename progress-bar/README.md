    • First we do UI components (look first commit in git)
    • Then we start with the state required
    • A state for the percentage value inside the bar
    • Use useEffect to change the percent value and also handle edge cases to not to go beyond 100
    • Add accessibility headers from google which helps in text to speech recognition
    One more state for checking completion of loading .
