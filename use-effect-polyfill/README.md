- useEffect runs after rendering the component
- useEffect takes two arguments , one is function and one is dependency array
- useEffect runs once if the dependency array is empty (meaning it is same in rerenders)
- useEffect runs all the time when the dependency array changes, meaning the value in depedency array changes
- if there is no dependency it will run all the time when component rerenders
- there is also cleanup function inside useEffect which runs first even before the useEffect (except for the first time)
- we use useEffect for the side effects (the things that are not directly related to the UI rendering)
